# spectator-counter
A simple yet effective counter app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Through building this app, I was introduced to JavaScript as part of an ongoing course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). Some major concepts that I learned:
- creating and initializing variables using 'let'
- The Document Object Model
- Strings in JS and catenation of them
- Catenation of strings during initialization

Apart from these and some other concepts, I also learnt to deploy it using netlify.

This app counts the number of spectators in football stadium using the increment button. When a particular number is to be captured, the save button is used and that number appears as a previous entry and the count is reset to 0. One can start counting again as per needs.
